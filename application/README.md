# Application Helm Charts

This directory contains `application` type Helm charts that are designed to deploy specific applications to Kubernetes clusters.

## Purpose

Application Helm charts serve as templates for deploying applications with predefined configurations and best practices. These charts encapsulate application deployment specifications, including:

- Container configurations
- Service definitions
- Configuration management
- Resource allocations
- Security contexts
- Health checks

The application charts in this repository follow consistent patterns and standards to ensure reliable deployments across different environments.

## Usage

Application charts should be used when deploying complete applications rather than infrastructure components or libraries. They provide a standardized way to package, version, and deploy applications to Kubernetes clusters.
