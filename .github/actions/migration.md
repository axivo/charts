# GitHub Actions Code Migration Mapping - Analysis in Progress

## MIGRATION STATUS: REVIEW REQUIRED

**Analysis of migration from `/Users/floren/github/charts-old/.github/scripts` to the new GitHub Actions codebase reveals missing functionalities that need to be addressed.**

## REQUIRED WORKING PATTERN FOR CODE CHANGES

**üö® CRITICAL: NO CODE EDITS WITHOUT EXPLICIT PERMISSION üö®**

When implementing or fixing functionality in this codebase, **STRICTLY FOLLOW** this approval process:

1. **ANALYSIS ONLY**: Complete thorough analysis and provide detailed findings
2. **SHOW DIFF FOR REVIEW**: Present proposed changes as diffs using `dryRun: true`
3. **WAIT FOR EXPLICIT APPROVAL**: Never execute actual file edits without explicit "proceed" permission
4. **STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION**: After approval, implement one change at a time with confirmation
5. **REVERT IF REQUESTED**: Immediately revert any unauthorized changes if requested

**This pattern ensures:**
- Full control over code changes
- Proper review of all modifications
- Step-by-step implementation with oversight
- Ability to course-correct before problems occur

**Example interaction flow:**
```
Assistant: "Here's the diff for Step 1 - updating migration.md:"
[shows diff with dryRun: true]
Human: "Approved, proceed with this change"
Assistant: [executes the change]
Assistant: "Step 1 complete. Here's the diff for Step 2:"
[continues with next step only after approval]
```

## MIGRATION VALIDATION PROCESS

### How to Perform Migration Validation

When comparing functions from the old codebase to the new codebase, follow this systematic validation process:

#### **Step 1: Locate Function Usage in Old Codebase**
1. **Find where the function is called** - Don't just analyze the function in isolation
2. **Understand the function's purpose** - What problem does it solve in the workflow?
3. **Identify dependencies** - What other functions or modules does it interact with?
4. **Document the complete functionality** - Include all capabilities, not just the main logic

#### **Step 2: Search New Codebase Comprehensively**
1. **Search by function name** - Look for exact matches first
2. **Search by functionality keywords** - The functionality might be renamed
3. **Search by API calls** - Look for the same GitHub API calls or similar patterns
4. **Check multiple locations** - Functionality might be split across several files/classes
5. **Examine similar workflows** - The logic might be integrated into related processes

#### **MANDATORY: Complete Codebase Search Protocol**

**BEFORE declaring any functionality missing or implementing new methods, you MUST:**

**A. SYSTEMATIC FILE-BY-FILE SEARCH:**
1. **Read every single file** in `/Users/floren/github/charts/.github/actions/`
2. **Search for exact function name** in each file
3. **Search for similar method names** (variations, shortened names, etc.)
4. **Search for related keywords** from the old function's purpose
5. **Search for API calls** used by the old function (e.g., `github.rest.actions.getWorkflowRun`)
6. **Search for similar functionality patterns** across all service classes

**B. METHOD INVENTORY VERIFICATION:**
1. **List ALL methods** in every service class that could be related
2. **Check private methods** (starting with #) - functionality might be private
3. **Check helper methods** - functionality might be split into smaller methods
4. **Check inherited methods** - functionality might be in base Action class
5. **Check static methods** - functionality might be implemented as static

**C. FUNCTIONALITY MAPPING:**
1. **Map each capability** of the old function to potential new implementations
2. **Check if functionality is distributed** across multiple classes/methods
3. **Verify integration points** - how the functionality is called in workflows
4. **Confirm the complete workflow chain** from trigger to completion

**D. EVIDENCE DOCUMENTATION:**
```
#### functionName
New classes/methods:
**SEARCH VERIFICATION COMPLETED:**
‚úÖ Searched all 47 files in /Users/floren/github/charts/.github/actions/
‚úÖ Found these related methods: [list every method found]
‚úÖ Confirmed no duplicate functionality exists
‚úÖ Verified no similar implementations present
**EXISTING METHODS ANALYSIS:**
- Method1: [exact functionality and differences]
- Method2: [exact functionality and differences]
**CONCLUSION:** [Based on complete search, functionality is/isn't present]
Status: [Only update after completing full search verification]
Technical Details: [Implementation details with evidence of complete search]
```

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FAILURE MODES TO PREVENT:**

‚ùå **INCOMPLETE SEARCH** - Searching only obvious files/classes
‚ùå **ASSUMPTION-BASED ANALYSIS** - Assuming functionality doesn't exist without thorough search
‚ùå **DUPLICATE METHOD CREATION** - Creating new methods when similar ones exist
‚ùå **IGNORING PRIVATE METHODS** - Missing functionality implemented as private methods
‚ùå **MISSING DISTRIBUTED LOGIC** - Not finding functionality split across multiple methods
‚ùå **SKIPPING BASE CLASSES** - Missing inherited functionality from Action base class
‚ùå **OVERLOOKING STATIC METHODS** - Missing functionality implemented as static methods
‚ùå **RUSHING TO IMPLEMENTATION** - Starting implementation before completing search verification

**üö® MANDATORY VERIFICATION CHECKLIST:**

Before declaring ANY function missing or incomplete:
‚ñ° Read every file in `/Users/floren/github/charts/.github/actions/`
‚ñ° Searched for exact function name across all files
‚ñ° Searched for similar/related method names
‚ñ° Checked all private methods (#methodName)
‚ñ° Checked all static methods
‚ñ° Verified base class Action methods
‚ñ° Mapped old function capabilities to new implementation possibilities
‚ñ° Documented complete search results with evidence
‚ñ° Confirmed no existing functionality would be duplicated
‚ñ° Listed ALL related methods found during search

**VIOLATION: Creating duplicate methods or missing existing functionality constitutes CRITICAL FAILURE**

#### **Step 3: Compare Implementation Details**
1. **Function signature comparison** - Parameters, return types, async/sync
2. **Core functionality analysis** - Does it do the same thing?
3. **API calls mapping** - Are the same GitHub/external APIs being called?
4. **Error handling comparison** - Is error handling equivalent?
5. **Edge case handling** - Are the same edge cases covered?

#### **Step 4: Identify Migration Pattern**

**‚úÖ FULLY MIGRATED**: 
- All functionality present with equivalent or enhanced capabilities
- Same or better error handling
- All edge cases covered
- Integration points maintained

**‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY MIGRATED**:
- Core functionality present but missing some features
- Simplified implementation that covers main use cases
- Some edge cases not handled
- Integration points may be different

**‚ùå INCOMPLETE**:
- Missing critical functionality
- Stub implementations that don't work
- Broken integration points
- Significant capability gaps

**‚úÖ INTENTIONALLY SIMPLIFIED**:
- Functionality was deliberately removed or simplified
- Architectural decision to change behavior
- Original complex logic replaced with simpler approach
- May represent a design trade-off

**‚ùå NOT MIGRATED**:
- No equivalent functionality found
- Complete absence of the capability
- No alternative implementation

#### **Step 5: Document New Architecture**
1. **List all new locations** - Where is the functionality now implemented?
2. **Map old parameters to new parameters** - How do function signatures differ?
3. **Document architectural changes** - How was the implementation restructured?
4. **Identify design decisions** - Why were changes made?
5. **Note integration changes** - How do other parts of the system use this functionality?

#### **Step 6: Validation Examples**

**Example: Complex Function Analysis**
```
OLD: checkWorkflowRunStatus({ github, context, core, runId }) -> boolean
- Lists workflow jobs via REST API
- Analyzes individual job steps  
- Downloads and searches logs for warnings
- Returns boolean indicating issues found
- Used by: reportWorkflowIssue() for issue detection

NEW: Split across multiple locations
- Rest.getWorkflowRun() -> basic workflow data only
- Issue.#validate() -> stub that always returns false  
- Workflow.reportIssue() -> only checks config warnings

STATUS: ‚ùå INCOMPLETE
Reason: Critical error/warning detection functionality is missing and must be implemented
```

**Example: Simple Function Analysis**
```
OLD: fileExists(path) -> boolean
NEW: File.exists(path) -> boolean
- Same functionality
- Same parameters and return type
- Uses modern async/await pattern
- Better error handling

STATUS: ‚úÖ FULLY MIGRATED
```

#### **Required Validation Template for Each Function**

```
#### functionName
New classes/methods:
Determine with 100% certainty the old code functionality is not already present into different classes and methods. For this, you need to perform a comprehensive line-by-line analysis of every file in the /Users/floren/github/charts/.github/actions codebase.
Status: The status is updated during current chat session, allowing an exact tracking of the migration progress, for example ‚ùå INCOMPLETE will tell us we already started working the migration into a previous chat.
Technical Details:
The technical details are used for understanding what is the new implementation logic and why the old codebase was changed.
```

#### **Critical Implementation Requirements**

When implementing or fixing functionality in the new codebase, **STRICTLY FOLLOW** these patterns:

**Class Structure & Method Organization:**
- **Constructor first** - Always place constructor at the top of the class
- **Alphabetical method ordering** - All methods after constructor must be in strict alphabetical order
- **Private methods before public** - Within alphabetical order, private methods (#methodName) come before public methods
- **No deviations** - Even helper methods must follow alphabetical ordering

**Method Implementation Standards:**
- **No empty lines inside methods** - Method bodies contain zero blank lines
- **No comments inside methods** - Method bodies contain zero comments of any kind
- **Self-documenting code** - Code must be clear without internal comments
- **Single responsibility** - Each method performs one clear operation

**Documentation Requirements:**
- **JSDoc headers mandatory** - Every method must have proper JSDoc documentation above it
- **Parameter documentation** - Document all parameters with types and descriptions
- **Return documentation** - Document return values with types and descriptions
- **Example JSDoc format:**
```javascript
/**
 * Brief description of what the method does
 * 
 * @param {Object} params - Parameter object
 * @param {string} params.owner - Repository owner
 * @param {string} params.repo - Repository name
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} - Description of return value
 */
async methodName({ owner, repo }) {
  return this.execute('operation name', async () => {
    // Implementation without comments or blank lines
    const result = await this.someOperation();
    return result;
  });
}
```

**Error Handling Patterns:**
- **Use execute() pattern** - Wrap operations with `this.execute('operation name', async () => {...})`
- **Typed errors** - Use appropriate error classes (ReleaseError, GitError, etc.)
- **Operation context** - Include clear operation names for debugging
- **Fatal vs non-fatal** - Specify error severity appropriately

**Function Signatures:**
- **Parameter objects** - Use destructured parameter objects `{ owner, repo, ...params }`
- **Consistent naming** - Follow existing parameter naming conventions
- **Return consistency** - Return consistent data structures within service classes

**VIOLATION OF THESE STANDARDS CONSTITUTES IMPLEMENTATION FAILURE**

#### **Common Validation Mistakes to Avoid**
1. **‚ùå Don't assume missing = incomplete** - May be intentionally simplified
2. **‚ùå Don't just check function names** - Functionality might be renamed or restructured  
3. **‚ùå Don't ignore integration points** - Check how functions are used together
4. **‚ùå Don't miss split implementations** - One old function might become multiple new methods
5. **‚ùå Don't skip architectural changes** - New patterns might achieve same goals differently
